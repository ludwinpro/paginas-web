            <h1 class=" open-sans-regular">The Strokes</h1>
            <p>The Strokes are an American rock band formed in New York City in 1998. 
                The band is composed of lead singer and primary songwriter Julian Casablancas, 
                guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr., bassist Nikolai Fraiture, 
                and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. They were a leading group of the early-2000s 
                post-punk revival and garage rock revival movements.

                The release of their debut EP The Modern Age in early 2001 sparked 
                a bidding war among major labels, with the band eventually signing to RCA Records.
                 That summer, they released their debut album, Is This It, to widespread critical 
                 acclaim and strong sales. It has since appeared on numerous "best album" lists. 
                 It was followed by Room on Fire (2003) and First Impressions of Earth (2006), 
                 both of which sold well but failed to match Is This It in
                 immediate critical success, despite positive reviews nonetheless.

                Following a five-year hiatus, they released Angles (2011) and Comedown Machine (2013) 
                to generally positive receptions but dwindling sales. Following the end of their initial
                 contract with RCA, they released the Future Present Past EP (2016) through Casablancas'
                  label Cult. The band were relatively inactive throughout the decade, making infrequent 
                live appearances and directing most media attention to individual projects.

                In 2020, they released their first studio album in seven years, The New Abnormal, 
                produced by Rick Rubin and released through Cult and RCA. The album received highly 
                positive reviews and was considered a return to form by critics. 
                It went on to win Best Rock Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.

            <h2 class=" open-sans-regular"> History</h2>
            <p> Lead singer-songwriter Julian Casablancas,
                 guitarist Nick Valensi, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti started playing
                  together as teenagers while attending Dwight School in Manhattan, 
                  and formed an informal band in 1997. They later added bassist Nikolai 
                  Fraiture to their ranks, a close childhood friend of Casablancas who had 
                  attended the Lycée Français de New York with him. At the end of 1998, 
                  the group invited guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. to play with them.
                  
                  He had just moved to New York City and reconnected with Casablancas, 
                  whom he knew from their brief stints at the private boarding school 
                  Institut Le Rosey, near Nyon, Switzerland. The two soon became roommates.

                The Strokes released their debut album, Is This It, 
                in the US in October 2001. The album was produced by Gordon Raphael,
                 as was their follow-up album Room On Fire.[6] RCA Records delayed the North 
                 American (US) release over concerns with the album's cover and lyrics. 
                 The internationally released cover features a black-and-white photo of 
                 a gloved hand on a woman's naked backside, shown in semi-profile 
                 (photographer Colin Lane's then-girlfriend)[7] while the North American 
                 version replaced it with a photo of particle collisions in the Big European
                  Bubble Chamber. RCA replaced the track "New York City Cops" with "When

                   It Started", as the former featured potentially inflammatory lyrics in 
                   the wake of the September 11 attacks. The track "New York City 
                   Cops"—featuring the refrain, "New York City Cops, they ain't too smart"—was
                    listed as No. 12 on New York magazine's "Ultimate New York Playlist"
                     on March 1, 2010. Despite its delayed release (and the potential 
                     controversy), Is This It received critical acclaim—among other accolades,
                      four stars from Rolling Stone, and a 9.1 from Pitchfork Media.
                       The album made many critics' top-ten lists, was named the best album of the year by Entertainment Weekly and Time, and (in an article previewing summer concerts) NME urged readers to attend The Strokes' shows—as they were touring some of the "best pop songs ever". While critics noted the influence of CBGB stalwarts Television, Casablancas and bandmates said they had never heard the band, instead citing the Velvet Underground and the Doors as reference points.
